     The printf utility formats and prints its arguments, after the first, under control of the format.  The format is a character string which contains three types of objects: plain characters, which are simply copied to standard out-
     put, character escape sequences which are converted and copied to the standard output, and format specifications, each of which causes printing of the next successive argument.

     The arguments after the first are treated as strings if the corresponding format is either c, b or s; otherwise it is evaluated as a C constant, with the following extensions:

           o   A leading plus or minus sign is allowed.
           o   If the leading character is a single or double quote, the value is the character code of the next character.
